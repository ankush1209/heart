You make me laugh when I want to cry,
Make me live when i want to die.
Make me smile when I want to frown,
You turn my sad life upside down.
Believe in me when no one else does,
You are my now,my will and my was.
When you call my name I begin to blush,
I'm afraid people notice I need you so much.
When I'm with you time flies fast,
Its like present is the past.
I need you more than you can believe,
Love you more than you can conceive.
Think about you evry night and day,
And hope we can stay together this way,
I don't want us to be any other way,
I promise to love you more everyday.
